My version is of 2007-09-13, I came across the following
p 135 2nd para delete "Maybe explain what "self" ......item)
p 138 3rd para "you should fell free" -> "you should feel free"
p 196 Given the way the table is formated I found it difficult to  
identify the various protocols.
p 236 Last para "Once the morph handles mouse events, it you cannot  
grab it" should read "Once the morph handles mouse events, you  
cannot grab it"
